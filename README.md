# MBTA-Arrivals 0.7

Shifting focus over to Raspberry Pi + Python + RGB Matrix

## Stuff to do:

- Sit in station and watch trains come in (this should be fun)
- Integrate API key and figure out how to mask secrets from Github
- Working on getting all my random code together in one place
- Get rgb-matrix figured out and print var to matrix
- Refine headsign logic using MBTA best practices
