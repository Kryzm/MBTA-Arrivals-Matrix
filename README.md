# MBTA-Arrivals 0.6

This project will likely never see the light of day, but we carry on nonetheless.  

## Stuff to do:

- Sit in station and watch trains come in (this should be fun)
- Dynamic JSON document may need to be bigger - ESP8266 supports up to 120kb so not an issue there
- Temporarily switched to Worldtime instead of MBTA API, since it's less complex
- Screen flicker on refresh - see if this can be fixed
- Integrate API key and figure out how to mask secrets from Github
