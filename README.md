Ongoing unfinished project 

## Stuff to do:

- Integrate PXMatrix library and output JSON variables to screen
- Add API key and figure out how to obfuscate from Github
- Follow guidelines from [MBTA best practices](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api/best-practices) for organizing data
- Determine if 64x32 is enough or if I should get another [panel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SDMWX9R?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) for 128x32
- Make build guide with photos and maybe video
